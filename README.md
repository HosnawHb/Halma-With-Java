## Gameplay:
🕹️ The objective of Halma is to strategically navigate your pieces to your opponent's territory by employing simple movements, such as moving to adjacent houses or executing exhilarating chain jumps over other pieces.</br>
It's worth noting that pieces are allowed to move backward, and there are no penalties for jumping over existing pieces. ♟️ </br>

## Game Completion:
🏁 The game reaches its thrilling conclusion when a player successfully relocates all their pieces to the opponent's field. Once the game wraps up, the victorious player's name, along with the total number of moves made, is recorded in a file. Each transition of turns counts as a move, adding to the excitement. 🎉💾

## Game Environment:
💻 Upon launching the program, users are greeted with a menu offering various enticing options: start the game, view high scores, or gracefully exit. </br>
After choosing to commence the game, players are prompted to enter their names, specify the size of the board (n), and determine the number of rows of pieces (m). It's important to keep in mind that the board size must be an even number, and the number of rows should fall within the acceptable range of 1 − 𝑛 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 1.</br>
Any invalid input will not be accepted. 📊🖥️ </br>
Additionally, within the game environment, players have convenient options to return to the main menu or indulge in an exhilarating rematch without recording a score. 🔄🏆 </br>
